## Compliance Configuration Scanner - Architecture

The CCS is designed as a modular Python application that scans systems, processes findings, and generates secure reports. The architecture follows security-first principles with clear separation of concerns.

### 1. Scan Modules (`/scanners/`)
Collect security configuration data from target systems

### 2. Data Processing (`/processing/`)
Clean, validate, and normalize scan data

### 3. Compliance Engine (`/compliance/`)
 Map scan results to compliance frameworks

### 4. Security Layer (`/security/`)
Handle authentication, encryption, and audit logging

### 5. Data Storage (`/storage/`)
Secure persistent storage of scan data and results

### 6. Reporting (`/reports/`)
Generate compliance reports

## Data Flow

1. **Scan Initiation:** User initiates scan through CLI
2. **System Detection:** Determine target OS and available checks
3. **Secure Scanning:** Execute security checks with minimal privileges
4. **Data Validation:** Validate and sanitize all collected data
5. **Compliance Mapping:** Map findings to framework requirements
6. **Risk Analysis:** Assess and prioritize security findings
7. **Secure Storage:** Encrypt and store all results
8. **Report Generation:** Create reports for IT teams and business leaders
9. **Audit Logging:** Log all activities for security monitoring

## Security Architecture

- **Input Validation:** All user inputs and system data validated
- **Least Privilege:** Scanner runs with minimal required permissions  
- **Encryption:** All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all operations
- **Access Controls:** Role-based access to different functions
