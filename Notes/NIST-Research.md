# NIST CSF 2.0 - Quick Reference Notes

## What is it?
A government checklist for cybersecurity. Companies use it to make sure they're doing the basics right.

## The 6 Categories

**GOVERN** - Do leaders care about cybersecurity?
**IDENTIFY** - What do we own that needs protecting?  
**PROTECT** - What security stuff do we have in place?
**DETECT** - Can we spot when something bad happens?
**RESPOND** - What do we do when we get attacked?
**RECOVER** - How do we get back to normal?

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 3-4
- Are passwords strong enough?
- Is Windows Firewall on?
- What software is installed?
- Who has admin access?

### Week 4-6 
- Are security updates missing?
- Do backups work?
- Are logs being saved?

### Week 7+
- Is data encrypted?
- Are user permissions reviewed?

## Why This Matters

**Problem:** Security teams spend weeks manually checking if systems are secure
**Solution:** Automatically scan in hours
**Result:** Companies know their security status in real-time instead of once a year

Each check maps to a NIST rule and gives a PASS/FAIL result with specific recommendations for fixes.
