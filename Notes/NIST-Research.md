# NIST CSF 2.0 - Quick Reference Notes

## What is it?
A government checklist for cybersecurity. Companies use it to make sure they're doing the basics right.

## The 6 Categories

**GOVERN** - Do leaders care about cybersecurity?

**IDENTIFY** - What do we own that needs protecting?  

**PROTECT** - What security stuff do we have in place?

**DETECT** - Can we spot when something bad happens?

**RESPOND** - What do we do when we get attacked?

**RECOVER** - How do we get back to normal?

## Why This Matters

**Problem:** Security teams spend weeks manually checking if systems are secure

**Solution:** Automatically scan in hours

**Result:** Companies know their security status in real-time instead of once a year

Each check maps to a NIST rule and gives a PASS/FAIL result with specific recommendations for fixes.
